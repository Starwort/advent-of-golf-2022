# Rules for J submissions

- Solutions should be single-file programs.
- Solutions should take input, without trailing newlines, from stdin.
- Solutions should print two answers separated by whitespace (`' '` or `'\n'`) to stdout.
- Solutions should not provide unrelated output (e.g. logging, spurious blank lines).

Run this as `./runner.sh <day_number>`.

## Notes
`runner.sh` does not make assumptions about your method of invoking a J interpreter. You must set `$J_COMMAND` to point to your J binary of choice for `runner.sh` to be able to run your code.
