Run this as `./runner.sh <day_number>`.  Assumes you have $CC set in
your environment (defaulting to 'cc'), and a single file day_$number.c
which will be compiled; also assumes you are on a 64-bit platform
(that is, 'long' is adequate for a 64-bit type).  Compiler warnings
are okay, but for now, the framework is not set up for enabling
special options like enabling K&R syntax.  Your program will be fed
input on stdin, including a final trailing newline, and must output
two results separated by whitespace (one or two lines is okay); exit
status is ignored.

Scoring counts newlines on preprocessor lines, but not on regular code
lines (as they can be elided with no difference to C), as in:

  echo $(( $(wc -c <day_$number.c) - $(wc -l <day_$number.c)
           + $(grep -c '^[[:space:]]*#' <day_$number.c) ))

Teaching the runner how to score submissions (all text after the last
#endif might be a good starting point) would be nice.
