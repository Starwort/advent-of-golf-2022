# Advent of Golf 2022

Code golf solutions for Advent of Code 2022

This repo aims to serve as a central repository of golfed (i.e. as short as possible solutions) Advent of Code 2022 solutions.

## Submitting solutions

To submit a solution for your language, just submit a pull request. If your language does not yet have a folder, feel free to make one! Please try to define rules that are as similar to those of Python or Rust as possible:
- reading input should be part of the runner, not the solutions; 
- any form of expression allowed by the language can be extracted via a function;
- Add a README.md that explains the rules to (aim to) adhere to with regards to what to count towards the character count, the input method, etc.

When adding a solution, please *do not* delete previous solutions; prefer shadowing them, or, if the language does not allow that, renaming the previous solution (e.g. to the hash of its original commit)

## Solution format

Solution format will vary by language. See `[language name]/README.md` for information for your language.

## Scores

The part you're all here for

Here is a list of scores, separated by language and day and scored according to the language's rules (**bytes** unless specified). Scores (in brackets) indicate a score that is not accepted (e.g. because it violates an IO rule, or requires a modification to the language)
